#### By _**Alex Garcia, Ben Kirby, Daniel Bennett, and Robert Bruce**_

## Description

_Quizzle Me Timbers takes the classic game of trivia usual played at bars or work parties and puts it on the web to streamline the process of keeping track of questions, teams, and score. This is possible by using web pages designated for both the host and another for the team players._



## Setup/Installation Requirements

 * navigate to site: https://quizzlemetimbers.firebaseapp.com/
 * For Host:
    * login to the host view by using username: alextrebek@jeopardy.com and password: suckittrebek
    * here you will be able to create a game that will then generate a key that the teams will use to login to the current game. (save this code for recovery if something happens or want to resume game at a later date)
    * you will also see a list of questions, to add these questions click the plus questions, if you'd like a question not to show you can delete a question from the list.

* For Teams:
  * Enter Game key that host has generated and click "join game"
  * create team name and click submit team





## Known Bugs

* host login can be bypassed by directly forcing the /host route.
